Powershell
==========

These are some general purpose Powershell scripts and tools that I wrote while learning Powershell. I hope they help someone! Feel free to comment on them.

They were written in Powershell 4.0 and have only been tested in that version of PS.

Additional documentation can be found Readme.md files in the individual project folders.
