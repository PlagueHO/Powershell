Powershell
==========

These are some general purpose Powershell scripts and tools that I wrote while learning Powershell. I hope they help someone! Feel free to comment on them.

They were written in Powershell 4.0 and have only been tested in that version of PS.

Additional documentation can be found Readme.md files in the individual project folders.

## DSCTools
This module provides miscellaneous helper functions for setting up and using Powershell DSC.

## ACLReportTools
This module contains functions for generating reports of file, folder and share ACL's, storing the reports and comparing them with earlier reports.

## Compare-ShareACLs - DEPRECATED!
This script is able record all the ACLs on specified SMB shares on computer and then report

This script has been deprecated. The ACLReportTools module replaces it.
